# Self-managed Elastic Scale Hybrid Server Using Budget Input and User Feedback

This is a component developed as part of my Master's thesis "Solutions for Improving Model Simulation in the Virtual Watershed Platform" .

In this work, an innovative server-usage optimization strategy was proposed to enable cost-effective deployment of model containers to reduce the waiting time of jobs in a cloud environment. The developed prototype application includes an elastic hybrid server cluster comprising owned and rented servers that can facilitate on-demand provisioning of the computing resources based on job arrivals and ensures reduced waiting time for the modeling jobs within the allocated budget amount. The proposed approach was tested on the modeling platform of Virtual Watershed (https://virtualwatershed.org/). The prototype contains a dashboard to track the progress of model run jobs and a user feedback monitoring module to generate auto alerts during severe performance issues
